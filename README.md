## Why This Extension?

### The Problem

Odoo developers, consultants, and power users frequently:
- Test different user permissions and workflows
- Support multiple clients with different instances
- Switch between development/testing environments
- Need to login with various roles for QA and support

This leads to constantly typing usernames and passwords, wasting time and breaking focus.

### The Solution

Odoo Quick Login reduces the login time from 30+ seconds to just 1 click:
- Save unlimited custom user credentials per Odoo instance
- Eliminate repetitive username/password typing
- Instantly switch between different user accounts
- Keep your test, dev, and production users separate

Unlike other solutions that offer only fixed login buttons (admin, portal, guest), this extension works with **any custom user** you need to save.
